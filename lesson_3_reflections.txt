When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  You might want to use a remote repository, rather than keeping work locally, when multiple people need to use the repository. If you keep everything locally, people who need to make commits might not be able to access the local repository. If you are the only person who needs access to the content, but you use multiple machines to do so, a remote repository would also be of benefit over keeping content locally.
